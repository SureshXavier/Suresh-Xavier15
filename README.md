This repository contains a simple Encryption and Decryption application developed using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using a secret key.
The project demonstrates basic cryptography concepts and provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy data manipulation.

Features:

I) Encryption: Users can input text and encrypt it using base64 encoding with a user-defined secret key.
II) Decryption: The application supports decrypting the encrypted messages using the same secret key.
III) Password Protection: A password is required to access the encryption and decryption functionalities.
IV) Graphical Interface: The project includes a user-friendly graphical interface developed using Tkinter.
V) Reset Option: Users can easily reset the input fields to start a new encryption or decryption process.

Usage:

I)Run the script and enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
II)Input the secret key for encryption or decryption.
III)Click the "ENCRYPT" button to obtain the encrypted message or the "DECRYPT" button to retrieve the original message.
IV)To reset the input fields, click the "RESET" button.

Feel free to explore and use this Encryption and Decryption application for securing your messages. Contributions and improvements to the project are always welcome!
